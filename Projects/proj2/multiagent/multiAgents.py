    (b) If timers are off and the dist to ghost is not zero, it's still bad but you can deduct less compared to (a)

    (d) If timers are on and the dist to ghost is not zero, try to run anyway. Deduct a few points, but less than (b).

    2) Amount of food left
    Rationale: Deduct points if a lot of food left

    3) Distance to food
    Rationale: Add a few points if nearest food is far, add a lot of points if nearest food is close

    4) Current score
    Rationale: Add a few points if current score is less, add a lot of points if current score is a lot. This penalizes staying in place.
